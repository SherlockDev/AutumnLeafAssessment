Q1:     added the line "global counter" in the function in order to make the counter variable a global variable

Q2:    after openinng the script directory in the command line i ran the command "pytest question2.py". 
        Running this test which determined that the output of "assert inc(3) was 4 which made the test false.
        Therefore, changed assert inc(3) == 5 to assert inc(3) == 4 in order to make the statement true and allow the script to run

Q3:     I declared the os and requests libraries which allowed for me to make use of the environmental variables and to request a response from a site url. I then created the while loop to run the test based on the number of iterations declared in the environmental variable "iterations" and to use the url stored in variable 'site'. I included the commands used for testing and using inputs as comments. This allowed for me to test the operation of the code which functioned correctly. 

Q4:     I installed and made use of Visual Studio COde as i could not get Docker to run on Ubuntu correctly. I have not been able to successfuly get docker to run on windows or my ubuntu VM and have run out of time to get it right. I modified the "Dockerfile" included to have the same declared environmental variables as the ones used in my question3.py script. But was unable to run this and test it.  

Q5:     Logged in to github and created a new repository name it, making it private so that only those with the link can see it, included the README file
